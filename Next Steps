Server Initialization:
- Create a socket
- Bind the socket to an IP address and port
- Listen for incoming connections.

Client Initialization:
- Create a socket.
- Connect to the server

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:
- After establishing a TCP connection, use the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to securely exchange keys.
- Both client and server generate their own private keys and corresponding public keys.
- They then exchange public keys over the established connection.
- Both sides use the received public key and their own private key to compute a shared secret.

Public Key Exchange and Verification:
- The server sends its public key to the client, optionally signed with a private CA key to simulate a certificate-based authentication.
- The client verifies the server's public key using the CA's public key (this step simulates verifying a certificate's authenticity).

Establishing a Secure Channel:
- Use the shared secret from the Diffie-Hellman exchange to derive a symmetric encryption key.
- All further communication is encrypted using this symmetric key, ensuring a secure channel.

Secure Communication:
- Implement encryption and decryption methods for messages using the symmetric key.
- For additional security, include message authentication using HMAC with a derived key.
